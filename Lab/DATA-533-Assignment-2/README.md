Motivation:
This package was written to deal with some of the common problems when working with Kaggle datasets, specifically
datasets related to supervised learning methods such as Multiple Linear Regression. 

The first sub-package will deal with data pre-processing methods and the second sub-package deals with feature
engineering.
